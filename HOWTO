This documentation purpose is to help with some common cases you may run accross.


Locate a line in a combined javascript or stylesheet file
=========================================================

If you want to find code from a line number, do a "View Source" of the javascript or stylesheet file itself. The resulting source is the same, but the view source window includes line numbers.

Now you can press CTRL-L to jump to a line number, relative to the combined javascript or stylesheet file.


Managing dependencies with YUI 3 modules
========================================

The YUI 3 website provides a dependency configurator:

 http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/configurator/

Select the components you need, then copy the urls from the "Results" box and convert them into `=require` directives for Juicer. For each require path delete the absolute part of the url up to, and including `build`.

To make this process easier, you can do this once, and then comment/uncomment specific includes:

/* =require from "%YUI3%" */

/* =require "/yui/yui-base-min.js" */
/* =require "/oop/oop-min.js" */
/* ...etc... */
/* =require "/event-custom/event-custom-min.js" */
/* =require "/classnamemanager/classnamemanager-min.js" */

/* these are disabled */

///* !require "/widget/widget-min.js" */
///* !require "/widget/widget-position-min.js" (overlay) */
///* !require "/widget/widget-position-ext-min.js" (overlay) */
///* !require "/widget/widget-stack-min.js" (overlay) */
///* !require "/widget/widget-stdmod-min.js" (overlay) */

Or you can create yourself different sets:

 // Include slider plus all its dependencies
 // (remember Juicer will not include the same file twice)

 /* =require from "%MYAPP%" */

 /* =require "/lib/yui/yui-common.js" */    <= this one contains requires for all the basic yui modules

 /* =require "/lib/yui/yui-slider.js" */    <= this one contains all basic yui modules PLUS slider dependencies


Preloaded modules in YUI 3
==========================

If you have included all dependencies in the Juicer output, you can instance YUI without specifying any further modules:

    var YUI = YUI().use("*");

    YUI.on('domready', function() {
      ...
    });
